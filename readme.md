2. **Map View**: It shows where crimes happen on a world map, making it easy to see which areas have more crime.
3. **Categories**: It groups crimes into different types, like theft or vandalism, so users can understand which types are most common.
4. **Hotspot Detection**: It finds places where many crimes happen close together, helping to identify areas that need more attention from law enforcement.
5. **Trend Analysis**: It looks at how crime changes over time, so users can see if it's getting better or worse.
6. **Preventive Measures**: It gives suggestions on how to prevent crime based on the analysis, like improving lighting or having more police patrols.

## Advantages

- **Easy Understanding**: Presents crime data in simple maps and charts, making it easy for anyone to understand.
- **Decision Making Support**: By showing where crime happens most and how it changes over time, it helps decision-makers plan better crime prevention strategies.
